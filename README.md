# Lending Club Case Study
> This project involves analyzing loan application data for a consumer finance company. The company aims to identify patterns that indicate whether a loan applicant is likely to default. By understanding these patterns, the company can make more informed decisions to minimize financial losses. The dataset includes information on past applicants who either fully repaid their loans, are still repaying, or defaulted. The objective is to use this data to predict the likelihood of default for future applicants, helping the company reduce risky loans and manage credit loss effectively.

## General Information
This project focuses on a consumer finance company that provides loans to urban customers. The company needs to decide whether to approve loan applications based on the applicantâ€™s profile. The challenge is to avoid business loss by denying loans to reliable payers and to prevent financial loss by approving loans to those who might default. The goal is to minimize financial losses by identifying risky applicants early on.

The dataset used contains historical data on past loan applicants and their repayment statuses, including those who fully repaid, are still repaying, or defaulted on their loans. By analyzing this data, the project aims to identify patterns and key factors that indicate the likelihood of default. This information will help the company make better decisions on loan approvals, rejections, and adjustments to loan terms.

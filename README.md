# Lending Club Case Study
> This case study explores how a finance company can use data analysis to make better loan approval decisions. 
By examining past loan data, we aim to identify factors that predict whether a borrower will default. 
This helps the company reduce financial losses by avoiding risky loans.

## General Information
The finance company wants to minimize losses from loan defaults by identifying high-risk applicants. 
The goal is to understand which factors indicate a borrower is likely to default, so the company can make informed decisions on loan approvals.

## Steps Performed
- Data Sourcing
- Data Cleaning
- Data Manipulation
- Data Analysis
- Conclusions & Recommendations

## Conclusions
- Defaulted loans are significantly fewer than fully paid loans, with 36-month loans being more common and loans predominantly taken by higher-grade borrowers.
- Loans average 9,800 and are mainly for rent, mortgage, and debt consolidation, with interest rates clustering around 7.5% and 10-15%, and longer-term loans having higher rates.
- Debt consolidation loans show high rates of both full repayment and default, with higher loan amounts and annual incomes around 50,000 being more likely to default.
- Higher grades (A, B, C) are linked to lower interest rates, while lower grades (D, E, F, G) face higher rates, and most borrowers have no public bankruptcy records, indicating a generally safer profile.
  
## Recommendations
- Tighten criteria for 36-month loans due to higher default rates and focus on higher-grade borrowers (A and B) with over 10 years of experience.
- Monitor and manage interest rates, particularly in the 5-15% range, and offer competitive rates for longer-term loans.
- Prioritize approving 36-month loans, especially for borrowers seeking debt consolidation or credit card debt relief.
- Provide financial education to lower-income borrowers, offer better terms for those without public bankruptcy records, and consider work experience and property ownership in loan assessments.
